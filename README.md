# font_patched

These fonts are mainly for my personal use.

There may be some mistakes. For example, font name `MonaspaceArgonFrozen SarasaGothicSC` don't work in WezTerm, but worked in Sublime Text. Also, the main font's original name liked `Monaspace Argon Frozen` worked. Seems if patch to and used `MonaspaceAr SarasaGothicSC` seems worked.
